#summary How do you make stages?

A stage creator is currently far away (I'd say after I get holes and launchers right), but you can still create stages!

Stages are XML files.  To begin, you can copy this template:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no" ?>
<stage name="simple" start="grid_id" goals="0">
</stage>
}}}

If you have version 0.1.1+ (revision 31+), you'll notice that this stage doesn't start, at that's because I made the loader much, much more strict.

*name* is the name of the stage.

*start* is the id of the grid where the character will start.  Because there's no grid called "grid_id" yet, L-Echo 0.1.1+ would exit with an error.

*goals* is the number of goals of the this stage.  You can have more goals than specified here.

Ok, now to add grids!

Basic grids:

{{{
<grid id="grid_id" x="0" y="0" z="0" prev="NONE" next="NONE" [goal="1"] [nodraw="1"] [noland="1"] [trig="grid2"]/>
}}}

Before you eagerly copy and run that, remove everything in brackets (and the brackets too!).
