#summary To 1.0, and beyond!

= Intro =

1.0 is still a long ways away.  Here's how we're (which currently only involves myself) gonna get there.

= Future Releases =

 *  0.3 - character model - likely to be hard coded
 *  0.3.1 - fix launch parabola - speed of the character and a more smooth transition between the character's arc to a platform and to...nowhere.
 *  0.3.2 - change the character's speed so the character walks at the same pace no matter, the distance of the grids; also, add running.


 *  0.4 - walking animation
 *  0.4.1 - walking on stairs animation
 *  0.4.2 - running animation
 *  0.4.3 - falling animation
 *  0.4.4 - landing animation

 *  0.5 - level creator...

 *  0.6 - audio

 *  0.7 to 1.0 - stages, stages, stages! And maybe more modes (fighting mode?)
